                            </header>
                            <p> I know what you'll say. Here comes another village idiot beating the same dead horse. Playground Games is likely working on it blah blah blah, here are my ideas blah blah blah, stop. I get it. Many have tread the path I approach before me. So I've decided to take a left at Albuquerque. I have a more or less proposition for Fable 4/reboot. Is it the best out there? No. Will it have some interesting ideas? Maybe, I'm unsure about what all has already been said. Is it just trying Personally I think it will be revealed at E3 with a teaser consisting of just a character talking (likely Theresa) over some shots of Albion, ending with a logo followed by "Coming 2020", then next E3 it'll get a full reveal ready to be a launch title for the next Xbox. What do you think. Alot of people think playground games is making fable 4 if they are not do you think there is a chance Microsoft has seen the amount of people asking for fable 4 and has tried to find someone else to take over it or work on it themselves. amp#x200B. 
I have been waiting almost 9 years for an actual sequel to fable 3, so if anyone wants a fable 4 whatcha Fable 4 hasn’t been confirmed but we would all love to see it at E3, so I was wondering what would you guys want for the next Fable game? Do you want a continuation from Fable 3, moving on from the industrial revolution? Or do you want it set in between Fable 1 amp 2? Or a completely new landspace and story altogether? (Each game has been a continuation from the first Fables blood line as you know) Or something else entirely? I'd like to see a deeper romance system. For example, I think have courtships where you get to know someone until you know what gifts they like, love, dislike, and hate. When they like you enough, you can take them on dates, and have a variety of options like restaurants, circus shows, stage plays, orchestra concerts, and even things for mischief, being rude, or being a weirdo. I'd think too, have your date respond differently based on the date location and your behavior, like some people might. I enjoy the Fable series from 1-3 now I know 3 gets a bad rep but there is some stuff that I liked in 3 that I think they could've done better but liked that was the magic and the politics. I loved how you could do magic combinations but I hope they could make the better and different variations. I liked the politics but I wish they could have been more impactful than they were and I hope there are some in the new game. From the others I hope the keep the good and evil appearance change A place for any new Fable 4 news. Share links and thoughts Personally i feel like if fable 4 is ever released one thing i'd love to see is the reintroduction of more spells and what not like Fable TLC had i felt the diversity in Will allowed the player to have different types of play throughs each time what would you guys like to see? EDIT: i wish there was a way to send all these critiques to Playground Games as i learned they are potentially working on Fable. What are your guys thoughts? Do you think it will be like a prequel? Or take place in between Fable 2 and 3? Or will the storyline take place after Fable 3. I feel like this could be a fun conversation, as I love the Fable games. Apparently Microsoft has contacted Playground Games to begin Fable 4. They have already began to call for staff in order to begin development for a "AAA Open World. 
I'm watching the new trailer for RDR2 and can't stop thinking about how great a foundation it is for Fable 4. Obviously we'd like to see unique features to Fable 4, though. A living world is what Albion needs and was designed for, ala the acorn. Which would be possible given this gens current technical abilities (even at its smallest scale). A horse could be a functional way to traverse Albion now upon seeing how RDR2 implements theirs. For a Fable 4 I am against having a gang, group Not a rumor. Not speculation. Will try to have more info in the future about possible details regarding What are some of the things you guys would like to see in the next Fable game? Was brainstorming while replaying Fable 3 and came up with a few things I wanted. 1. A significantly larger world. It was always fun to explore in Fable, but I feel like it was pretty easy to explore each area. I want a massive world that is a true challenge to completely uncover. 2. More missions/quests. Even with the sidequests I ran out of things to do much too quickly in previous Fable games. Edit: Sorry for any formatting issues. I'm in the Reddit Beta and it's showing some strange stuff on my end. Hopefully it's not too distracting. Accoring to this job posting (https://www.artstation.com/jobs/9nNR?utm_campaign=digestamputm_medium=emailamputm_source=jobs_digest_mailer), they are looking for for talent to create an Open World game. We already knew that, however, the posting states: gtRequrements: gt gt•Experience in a variety of animation styles gt gt•Creati. </p>
